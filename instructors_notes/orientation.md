Welcome to the new 2023 ViT Web Development Fundamentals course. This course is sponsored by {sponsor name}

This course aims to teach you a great foundational level of web development. For any of you that have taken this course in the past, expect this iteration to be quite a bit different. This course will teach you about Semantic HTML rather than general HTML. While both can be used to make great websites, semantic HTML is far superior in its execution, and it performs much better in SEO and search results. 

The intent is to teach in short bursts; you will be shown an example using semantic HTML, and then you will have the opportunity to recreate it for yourself. This approach assumes 2 things: you are willing to accept some level of "it just works", and that you will spend some amount of your own time researching other elements that are not taught in this course. This approach minimizes the lecture portion in order to maximize your keyboard time. There is NO substitute for keyboard time and actually writing code for yourself. 

Day 1 is the most lecture heavy, just to get some items out of the way. After that, you can expect to be completing between 3 and 5 exercises each night as well as (some nights) having an overnight assignment. Each of these will build on what you were taught during that night's session as well as previous sessions. 

Course expectations: 
- We expect you to show up each night ready to learn
- We expect you to interact in the course and ask questions; our instructors are some of the best in the world and have years of knowledge under their belt
- We expect you to be on time; even a few minutes of missed content can hamper your learning experience
- We expect that you use our office hours; our instructors can and will schedule 1:1 time with you if you want it
- We expect that you have cameras on and your Zoom name to match your actual name (e.g. xXGamerTagXx, zoomDood, LacyLuv, etc. are not acceptable)

What you can expect from this course: 
- Experienced, excited, and motivated instructors that are ready to teach you as much as we can about web development
- A development foundation that you can build on; we will teach you *how* to research web dev topics when you aren't sure what you are looking for
- A course that is worth your time; the only way to learn and get better at developing websites is to invest your time. We take this seriously and we are investing our time in you. If you feel like you aren't getting it, let us know. There is nothing to be embarrassed about- we all started exactly where you are right now. By the end of this course you will be amazed at what you have learned and what you can create

Learning Objectives:
- Students will be introduced to web development concepts, dozens of semantic tags, and foundational knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, and ES6 JavaScript concepts
- Students will be able to create general web pages with several interactive elements such as forms, data captures, validation, and responsive building concepts
- Students will participate in a collective group project; each student will develop portions of a website and collectively bring them together to encompass a full web page
