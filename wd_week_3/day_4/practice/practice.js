/*
TO DO APP

1. EASY: First write out a function that will add on to the existing list from the user's input.
2. EASY: Create a button at the bottom of the list to clear out the entire list.
3. HARD: With each item that is added, also add a 'Delete' button. NOTE: We need a running count to keep track of which id/element to delete.
4. NIGHTMARE: Using the running count, can you figure out a way to edit the task? NOTE: We need to add an 'Edit' button.
