## What is HTML?

- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the content of the page.


### The makeup (syntax) of a HTML tag

Here is an example of a basic HTML tag:

```HTML
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

all HTML elements use this structure. you have an opening arrow bracket, the name of the element, and the closing arrow bracket. nearly all HTML elements also have a closing tag that is identical to the opening tag with 1 exception: the / in the tag. 


```html
Element Description & Example: h1 - Main (used for headings)
<h1>ViT Academy</h1>
h2-h6 Subheadings
<h2>About Us</h2>
```

One thing I want you to note before we get rolling is that all programming/coding languages have ways to make comments in the code- notes that you can write to yourself or others that lets them know what's going on in the code. Keep that in mind as you open the next file. Now, let's start learning some semantic HTML, open the file named index.html in your browser. 

This example page shows a few elements being used properly, that is, *semantically*. Although there are easier ways to create a number of elements and insert text/images into them, it isn't proper HTML. Let's look at adding an image and link to our site.
