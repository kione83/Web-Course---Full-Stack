### The Box Model

When laying out a document, the browser's rendering engine represents each element as a rectangular box according to the standard CSS basic box model. CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes.

Every box is composed of four parts (or areas), defined by their respective edges: the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.

In modern browsers, there are developer tools that can provide visual virtualization of the box model.

Most styling issues are caused by a conflict in the box model and can be resolved with the developer tools and understanding.
