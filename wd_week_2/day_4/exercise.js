// Use Flexbox to place the three divs into columns, spaced evenly, with the letter centered in the middle of each column.

// Use JavaScript to change the background color of the A,B, & C divs to match the color of their respective borders. 
// Use Javascript to change the INNER HTML of the A,B, & C divs to the NAME of the color (ie, #A should read 'red',
// #B should read 'green', etc.)
